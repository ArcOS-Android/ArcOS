    <h1>Welcome to ArcOS</h1>
    <p>ArcOS is a custom Android operating system based on LineageOS 15.1. It’s designed to bring stable, clean ROMs to devices that have been left behind—either never officially supported or dropped early by LineageOS. Our first target is the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact (suzuran), and we’re working to make it reliable, lightweight, and open-source.</p>

    <p>This project is community-driven and focused on quality. We’re currently recruiting contributors for HAL development, Android app integration, and ROM-level feature merging. If you’re interested in helping out, check the XDA thread or reach out via Discord.</p>

    <p>Fun Fact. Even this website needs to be fixed as it is really basic.</p>
